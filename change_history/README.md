# Change History Archive

This folder contains historical documentation that is no longer accurate or relevant to the current codebase.

## Files in This Archive

### 1. `FRONTEND_ISSUES_ANALYSIS.md`
- **Created:** October 26, 2025
- **Archived:** November 1, 2025
- **Reason:** Critical issues identified were false positives after code verification
- **Key Finding:** All components correctly use token-based authentication; deprecated API file exists but is unused

### 2. `FRONTEND_FIXES_QUICK_GUIDE.md`
- **Created:** October 26, 2025
- **Archived:** November 1, 2025
- **Reason:** Suggested fixes for issues that don't actually exist
- **Key Finding:** Import pattern `import API from '@/lib/api'` correctly imports token-based client, not deprecated session-based client

## Why These Were Archived

Both documents claimed critical authentication issues causing 401 errors. After verification:

✅ **All API imports are correct** - `@/lib/api.js` exports `apiClient` by default  
✅ **All stores use consistent `loading` state** - No `isLoading` inconsistency found  
✅ **Token authentication works correctly** - All components use Bearer tokens  
⚠️ **Deprecated file exists but is unused** - `api-session-deprecated.js` can be deleted but isn't causing issues

## Lessons Learned

- Always verify file imports by checking the actual export statements
- Check git history to see if reported issues were already fixed
- Don't assume similar filenames mean wrong imports without verification
- Modern module bundlers correctly resolve default exports

## Current State (November 1, 2025)

The frontend authentication system is working correctly:
- All components use token-based authentication via `apiClient`
- Bearer tokens are attached to all API requests
- 401 errors trigger automatic logout
- No critical issues blocking functionality
